## MSDS Capstone Project: Bats!!!

### Setup
Setup local (to this directory) Python 3.9 environment
```
pyenv install 3.9
pyenv local 3.9  # Activate Python 3.9 for the current project
# You might need to also run: poetry env use 3.9

poetry install
```

### Progress status

|Stage |Task |Details  |Input |Desired Output |Github Issue |Status |
| --- |:---| :---| :---- |:--- |:---|:---|
|Data cleaning and pre-processing | Develop snipping tool | Developing a snipping tool that allows us to generate .wav  that contains bat calls based on the timestamp and frequency parameters from Raven Pro. | 1. Audio files in .wav format.   2.Detection file from Raven Pro in .txt format. | individual .wav files | https://github.com/uw-echospace/bat-detector-msds/issues/9 | Completed |
|Data cleaning and pre-processing | Generate individual spectrogram from snipping tool output  | Convert individual .wav file from snippet tool to spectrogram and save as .png file. | individual .wav output from snipping tool to .png images | .png images that contains bat calls. | https://github.com/uw-echospace/bat-detector-msds/issues/16 | In progress |
|Data cleaning and pre-processing | Identify false positive and generate negative sample  | Based on the images snipped from the spectrogram, we will determine the false positive from the generated images. | .png images generated from snipping tool. | .png images that contains bat calls. | https://github.com/uw-echospace/bat-detector-msds/issues/5 | Pending upstream |
|Image clustering | Implement KNN- clustering   | Referring to this [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-cluster-images-based-on-visual-similarity-cd6e7209fe34) to implement KNN clustering based on visual similarity| filtered .png images containing bat calls. Based on our hypothesis, there should be two distinct bat calls, ie feeding buzz and non-feeding buzz. | Images that are in each group. | TBD| Pending upstream |
