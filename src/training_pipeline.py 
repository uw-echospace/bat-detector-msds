Production (Prediction) Pipeline:
    Input: big wave file
    Step 1: Segment bat calls from larger wav file
    Step 2: preprocessing (e.g. resampling, normalisation, spectrogramming, et c.)
    Step 3: Classification
    Ouptput: List of bat call locations and associated classification (species of bat and type of call (e.g. social or feeding)

The training pipeline will replace the classification step with a training step, and may have a intervention point for humans to
